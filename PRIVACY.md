# PRIVACY

We minimize data and give users control.

## Your Rights
- Export: download a ZIP of your claims and proof metadata
- Delete: hard delete your account and tombstone public slugs
- Visibility: toggle which sources and fields appear publicly

## Data Sources
- You control which sources connect (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.) and what we store (claims & proofs only)
- We do not store raw emails/files; only structured claims and proof references

## Retention
- Claims retained until you delete them or your account
- Analytics aggregated and de-identified where possible

## Sharing
- Public cards expose projections only (no PII)
- AI chat uses verified facts only; prompts and answers are redacted
